        <p>THIS IS THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED! I BOUGHT THE FULL VERSION A WHILE AGO AND IT DIDN'T ONLY COME WITH THE GREATEST VERSION OF BROOMSTICKS WITH SOUND AND THE OPTION OF CREATING YOUR OWN PLAYERS BACKGROUNDS AND EVEN YOUR OWN GAME! IT ALSO CAME WITH BROOMSTICKS 3D (GREAT GAME!) AND LASERTRON (GREAT FUTURISTIC GAME PLAYED WITH TWO PLAYERS OR ONE!) PLAY THIS GAME LOTS IF YOU LIKE HARRY POTTER'S QUIDDITCH! I HAVE READ THE FIRST BOOK 14 TIMES, THE SECOND BOOK 14 TIMES, THE THIRD BOOK 13 TIIMES, AND THE FOURTH BOOK 11 TIMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE 'EM!!!!!</p>

        <p>Wassup Paul, This is my favorite game, i LOVED Broomsticks 3D! It would be really cool if u made a full version of it, instead of just flying around and catching gold balls (don't get me wrong, i like playing the game), it would be really cool if you made a Quidditch version of Broomsticks 3D, like Broomsticks, you know, I know that isn't easy, i do a little programming too, but i just noticed that you are good, and thought i'd make the suggestion, cya round The Man!</p>

        <p>Hey! I got the full version and it's awesome!!! But when i try broomsticks 3D it goes realy slow. We're takin it takes a good 50 seconds for the picture on the screen to move. It realy looks awesome though. Lasertron is realy cool too! I almost like it better than broomsticks. But the thing is the computer play is too easy, once you have mastered the game like me! :) I might try playing with a friend though. Thanks!!!</p>

      <div class="entry-response"><p>Thanks James! I'm glad you like the <a href="full.html">Full Version</a>! </p>
<p> If Broomsticks 3D is running that slow, that means that the OpenGL driver for your graphics card is not installed. Find out what graphics card you have, go to the website, and see if they have OpenGL drivers. Most cards do, but some cards only support Direct3D. :-( </p>
<p> That's true about Lasertron. I meant it to be a two-player game and so I didn't spend much time on the computer player. Sometime I should improve that.</p></div>

        <p>Dear Paul, I think that your game rocks. Would it be possible to make something that would enable all of Broomsticks loyal fans to challenge each other? Maybe make teams? Also, what program did you use to make Broomsticks and what internet adress would I be able to get one? I'd like to make my own computer games, although I'm only 14. Keep up the good work Paul! - Nick</p>
      </div>
      <div class="entry-response"><p>Thanks Nick! </p>
<p> I'm a programmer and so I made Broomsticks from scratch using the Java programming language. Programming can take years to master, but it is well worth it. I started when I was in grade school! </p>
<p> As for your suggestion, that would be cool. If I have time I should try doing something like that. I have done networking before. The only problem with doing networking for Broomsticks is that Java only trusts the host for security reasons. This means that all network traffic for the game would have to go through my computer, which would probably be too much given the number of people that are playing Broomsticks! Still, I will consider it.</p></div>

        <p>Just to let you know my name really is Harry Potter, and im not lying. Well anyway I think the game is great. I played the full version over my friends house and the 3D version was the best. You should think about selling this game to stores. BROOMSTICKS RULE!

        <p>I think that this game costs way too much. All the more expensive games have more useful options and are usually in 3D. They all are really good games. I'm not saying that this game is bad, it's fine, but it doesn't have a lot of options to spice the game up, and it's a very basic game. I would not pay $10 for a game like this. I would suggest advertising on your site because they're are so many visitors, and making money that way instead of ripping people off with a $10 game.</p>

      <div class="entry-response"><p>Most games cost a lot more than $10. The Full Version of Broomsticks comes with a bunch of options and a Broomsticks 3D game. It's a lot of fun! The people who have the full version know what I am talking about! :-)</p></div>

        <p>Hey, Paul. It's been a LOOONG time... I wouldn't blame you if you don't remember me, but it you do, that's great. Anyways, I was wondering if you have any updates on the Broomsticks game so far, like progress on the 3d version or more game features (if you remember I bought the game back around christmas 2000) Also, I'm just here to check back and stuff. I kinda got lazy and haven't worked on QBasic for awhile, and am currently making movies on Flash 5. I went to QBasic.com and it's help section only goes so far and i'm left guessing what to do next with it. It doesn't teach you much and i was thinking maybe you have found a better faq for QB. Anywayz, it's 12:00 pm here, so I should get to sleep... CU l8r</p>

<p> The full version does have some new features since you got it. It is much easier to make custom game settings and there are a few more options. </p>
<p> I haven't used QB for a long time, so I don't keep up with it anymore. Good luck with programming, I hope you stick with it!</p></div>

        <p>Hi! I just played the Advanced Broomsticks Game and... well to put it in one word... Excelent! Thing is, in the options, it said only 2 sets of characters, but I got to use mine. I had only just saved my first character set as well. Good news, they worked! (\(^o^)/) YAY! My new set of characters are going to be animated. Hope broomsticks takes animated characters otherwise it would be a bit on the downside (characters, not game. Game rocks!) Remember when I said I was making an alternative version on my computer? It didn't turn out right. Java got the better of me (\(^o^)/) Later. Matt PS: I hope everyone knows that I was the one that mentioned Broomsticks 3000, not Paul Rajilich. The new game's name is Broomsticks 3D, not Broomsticks 3000</p>
      </div>
      <div class="entry-response"><p>Thanks Matt! </p>
<p> Unfortunately, Java does not handle animated gifs. :-( The players will appear but will not be animated...</p></div>

        <p>I didn't see the reply from that other message until today. Thanks for putting them in =) I'm nearly finished with the new characters. Actually, they aren't really that new... I've changed the Red and Black balls, and added in two smiley faces. Plus they're animated =) =) =)</p>
