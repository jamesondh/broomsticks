<font face=helvetica size=-1>
Here is a fun little applet inspired by the game Quiddich from the
Harry Potter series and from the classic arcade game Joust. To play,
first click on the applet. Then, control player 1 using the arrow
keys. Control player 2 using the E, S, and F keys. It's easier to just
click on the keys rather than hold them down. Click on your up
key several times to start flying. If the display ever goes bad, minimize
and then raise your browser window.
<P>
The rules of the game are:
<ol>
<li> When two players collide, the player that is lower is bumped
    to the bottom of the screen.
<li> When a player collides with a black ball, the player is bumped.
<li> When a player gets close to the red ball, the player catches the ball.
<li> When a player puts the red ball in the opponent's basket, 10
    points are scored.
</ol>
<P>
That's it. Enjoy!
