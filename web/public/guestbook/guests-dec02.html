        <p>Hello again!!! I've finished my Kirby MegaMix characters! They look really really cool, and work just as well. Where are you Paul? It's December now, and the October guestbook is flooding! Maybe there should be a message board here... With all the smiley faces!!!! That'll be cool!!!!! I'm making another Items image as well. I might even make a field and sky to go with it! It's all Kirby this month! KIRBY KIRBY KIRBY!!! YAY!!!! ...I wish the cartoon was out here in Australia =) Oh well, got-sa go! Bye bye!!!</p>

      <div class="entry-response"><p>Matt, </p>
<p> I was out of town and now I am back. I have caught up on the guestbook but I do agree that we need a message board. </p>
<p> Cool about the new characters. I look forward to seeing them!</p></div>

        <p>Paul,<br>if you want to try doing split screen, try this: Use a windows computer with BR3D Open the Control panel Open Accessibility Options Go to the Mouse tab and acctivate MouseKeys. Click Settings for more info Test it. Open BR3D and use the NumPad to move around Posibly use:<br> QWE<br> A D<br> ZXC<br> to control player two (use it like the number pad.) What do you think?

        <p>Are you going to have another contest soon Paul? Like for the skies on Broomsticks 3D? We just got a bran-spankin-new computer. It is so sweet. I am going to try to make a night-time sky for br3d. I'll send it to you when I finish.</p>

<p> P.S. Does broomsticks 3d require the internet. Because I installed it on our new computer, though we don't have internet yet, and it put up this error thing, asking if i wanted to send Microsoft a reported error or not. ???</p>

      <div class="entry-response"><p>Excellent. </p>
<p> Nope, Broomsticks3D does not require the internet. What kind of graphics card do you have in the new computer? Do you have OpenGL drivers for it? What does the console.log file in the game directory say?</p></div>

        <p>Paul: To answer some questions above, I guess I do have OpenGL drivers because I looked it up in the computer search and it found an &quot;OpenGL32&quot;. Next, what do you mean by &quot;what does your console.log file say?&quot; I opened it and it has all that code stuff. The error said &quot;Information regarding the condition of br3d.exe when the problem occured; the opperating system version and computer hadware in use; your Digital Product ID, which could be used to identfy your liscence; and the Internet Protocal (IP) and the address of your computer.&quot; What??? If you don't know either, coud you e-mail me the three extra things(from the demo) so you can have skies and stuff. That way I can reinstall br3d and add the extra stuff to see if it makes a difference. Thanks!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="entry-response"><p>Actually, that does not mean that you have OpenGL drivers for your card. Microsoft includes a software-only OpenGL with Windows and that will not work with Broomsticks3D (way too slow). You may need to go to the website for your graphics card and download a driver. </p>
<p> Hmmm, that is a strange message. Is that the exact text? </p>
<p> The extra stuff will not help fix this problem. But once you get it working, let me know and I will send it to you. Haven't I already sent you those files before? :-)</p></div>

<p> Yes you have sent those to me before but I some how lost them when transfering Broomstick 3d to the new computer. I'll let you know when I need them, thanks.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="entry-response"><p>It depends on what graphics card you have. Right click on the desktop and click on Properties. This will take you to the &quot;Display Properties&quot; dialog. Click on the Settings tab. There you will see what kind of graphics card you have. Then, go to the website for the graphics card and look for driver downloads. This is usually in the support section. The driver documentation will tell you if the driver supports OpenGL. Most cards do support both DirectX and OpenGL but some cards only support DirectX.</p></div>

        <p>From a few posts ago... I read your reply to my post but you didn't put them up. And also, I can't take credit for the charcters. It was done by Antman Anext over at the DCU Animated Message Boards. They can be found here. http://users.ev1.net/~kryptcom All credit goes to him. I just made them into Broomsticks charcters. And his website is here... http://geocities.com/antmananext Ted Kendrick Ah, yes, I need to put them in the gallery. Thanks for the reminder. Oh, ok, thanks for straightening that out. I will credit him in the gallery as well as you. Thanks Paul.</p>

        <p>To download the demo of Broomsticks 3d go to www.broomsticks3d.com . Usually you will see the download link at the top of the page, but right now the demo is EXPIRED. Paul said something about having another, even better, demo available to download in January. There is a Broomsticks demo too, and you don't even have to download it!</p>
<p>Paul seems to be busy or out of town, but when he returns he can send those of you who are wanting to update your older Full Versions of Broomsticks, patches. HAPPY HOLIDAYS!</p>

      <div class="entry-response"><p>Thanks for helping out with the guestbook. Given how busy I am, I think that a message board format would be better. Specifically, it would be good to have a multiple subject message board. Ideas for topics would be: </p>
<p> - general discussion<br> - technical problems<br> - contributions (characters, skins, etc)<br> </p>
<p> This way, people could post new content (skins, characters, etc) without going through me. Of course, moderators would be needed.</p></div>

        <p>Paul, Your game is amazing. My friends and I found it a few weeks ago during downtime during computer science class, and have been hooked on it ever since. We are working out a Christmas gift deal to get 4 of the full versions, the order should be in soon. Every time we get a chance to play, we are challenging each other to a match! I am very impressed by the addictive simplicity of your outstanding game. It is a program that can provide hours of fun without the need for fast computers and long periods of load time. In short, your game is awesome! Keep up the excellent work! Lee</p>

        <p>BEN: Paul, the creator of Broomsticks, seems to be out of town. But the way I got my Full Version of Broomsticks is I sent $10 to:</p>
<p> Paul Rajlich 1709 Magnolia Drive St Joseph, IL 61873 USA</p>
<p>Each Full Version CD is $10. Unless you get one of the special deals like the 10 pack, I think is $60. Oh yes, I just remembered your from England, and you don't have $. Well I think you can use a money order system called PayPal. Go to the main page of Broomsticks and click on the link &quot;GET THE FULL VERSION&quot;. I've never used PayPal but I've heard it's easy to use. When Paul gets back he can better answer your questions. You also might try e-mailing him at: prajlich@ncsa.uiuc.edu</p>

        <p>I have thought about what Matthew Davis had said in the first post of the month of December. I have constructed a Message Board speacially for Broomsticks. Instead of using Paul's guestbook as a message board we can all use the message board that I have made. I am haping that this turns out good. If you are reading this message then PLEASE visit the message board. There is not that many members yet but if everybody wants to make this happen it can. Just go to the message board and start a question for people to answer. If this gets popular it would be a great thing to have. The message board is located on the link above or you can copy/paste this URL: http://broomsticks.proboards.com. I hope that this will be popular instead of using the questbook for a message board. Daniel, since you know alot about broomsticks and how to run it and everything, and you want this to happen, I can you make you a moderator. PLEASE make this happen. If you have any questions put them on the message board. Thank You.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="entry-response"><p>Joey, </p>
<p> this is exactly what I was talking about in my earlier post. If you make the categories that I mentioned before and recruit appropriate moderators, I will declare your message board official. :-) </p>
<p> A couple of quick questions though. What kind of limits does your board have? Specifically, are there limits to the amount of posts, will the board expire at some point? Is there a storage limit?</p></div>

        <p>I think that EZboard would be a good choice. It is certainly famous and your account can be free! ((I'm just saying this because I have an acount already and it would just be easier for me.)) EZBoard is also very easy to use. You can use HTML and they provide little things called &quot;emoticons&quot; that you can put in to show your emotions. The owner can make emoticons to go with his/her theme. the official wewbsite is http://www.ezboard.com/ I hope that this solves your message board problems. Ted Kendrick</p>

      <div class="entry-response"><p>Joey, </p>
<p> Good work with the messageboard! I will make it official if the following things are done: </p>
<p> - a section is added where people can post skins, characters, etc. Are attachments (uploads) possible with the message board?<br> - change the color scheme to match the Broomsticks color scheme. This will make the connection between the game and message board more clear.</p></div>

        <p>I have my items done Paul but I cannot get the background to become transparent. When I go to Image\Attributes (one Paint), I see the option of transparency but it is light gray and won't let me select it?!?! I tried selcting alland then going to Attributtes but it still didn't work. Help! </p>
<p> Also, just wondering, but on Broomsticks 3D there's the item.zip ... why are there 2 2d files in it? I think all the .zips are like that actually(having 2 files of the same thing). ~I'm working on a night-time background for both Broomsticks, it gonna be tight!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="entry-response"><p>In what format is the image stored? It may not support transparency. Try saving the image as a GIF. You can then convert to TGA later. </p>
<p> Really, you will probably be better off with something like Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro, or GIMP.</p></div>

        <p>PAUL: This is what Joey said:</p>
<p> &quot;I will make a link to broomsticks hopepage on the site. There is no limits to the amount of posts, although i set it that posts over 20 days will be deleted. If he wants me to change that i can. The board will not expire because its has popup ads. There is no storage limit exept like I said before that I set it that posts over 20 days will be deleted.&quot;</p>
      </div>
      <div class="entry-response"><p>My recommendation is not to delete any posts. That way, newcomers to Broomsticks can search through the message board to learn more about Broomsticks rather than posting the same questions over and over again.</p></div>

        <p>What do you mean Dougall, it's working out great I think. We just don't have many members(Me, Joey, and Dougall R the Members thus far) yet. Which is understandable since nobody knows if it is going to be made official by Paul or not.</p>
