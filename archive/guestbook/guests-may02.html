<li>Comments: {aul, just got full version of br3d. My question's are, is there a way to activate NPC's, a way how the game will end (points or snitch), when do u think network play will come out, and how many secret brooms r their (i've found 3)
<P>
<em>
Luke,
<P>
what does NPC stand for?
<P>
There are 3 secret brooms and an invisibility powerup. Right now, the game
doesn't end, think of it as practice. I will have a computer opponent sometime
in the near future. Network play is going to be later on.

If the graphics for Broomsticks 3D are not working, then you probably need
to download OpenGL drivers for your graphics card.

<li>Comments: I think Broomsticks (3D) is pretty cool. It's just that I live in Australia, so that I can't really afford the full version. There's a suggestion or two that I'd like to make for Broomsticks 3D:

1) If you explore the castle for more broomsticks, you should go into a "walking mode." where you can use the mouse to look around and keyboard arrows to move (or mouse buttons.)

2) There should be bigger stands, a referee, and you should wait for the whistle before you can start. (I've only got the demo, so maybe this IS what it's like in the full.)

3) There should be a cheap ($2) and full ($10) version of the game. That way, I don't have to pay as much. Because I live in Oz, the value of the Aussie dollar is about half as much as the US (boo) dollar which works out me paying TWICE AS MUCH as the "USians."

PS: Don't try logging on to my website until August 2002: I'm working on it, and I'll have a link on it that goes here!
<P>

<li>Comments: 2 things. One, I got a virus from you with your name on it. I assumed it was a new game, cause I bought your old CD. My firewall caught it, and I think it was a kind of virus program that does that automatically, but still, thought I'd let you know. Two, I bought the old CD from you, when it had broomsticks and the 3d demo (which is still a great game). Is there anyway you could make updates available for download to people who buy your games?
<P>
<em>
Hmmm... I'll look into it. Usually I am immune from viruses because I check my email
on IRIX (a unix operating system for SGI machines). But, I will check it out. Thanks
for letting me know.
<P>
Definitely, that is a good idea and I plan to do that. The only problem with your old 
version is that the new version is completely different and so the download would be
quite big.

<li>Comments: Hey Paul, i have not got to try broomsticks 3d yet except for the demo. And our computer is so old the download doesn't realy work so i'm hoping i'm one of the winners of the backgrounds contest so i can try the full version. Anyway i was going to ask if there are quaffles(red) in the game or just the snitch and black bludgerers? Also please keep it so you can still play a quidditch GAME. Not just find things in the castle. Finding the brooms does sound awesome though, do they make you go faster???
<P>
<em>
Daniel,
<P>
I'm sorry to say, but if the demo version does not work on your computer then the
Full Version will not work either. Most of the time you can get it to work by getting
the newest OpenGL drivers for your graphics card. However, if your computer is older
then it may not even have a 3D graphics card or it may have one that does not support
OpenGL.
<P>
Yes, you can play a GAME and all of the balls are there. However, there is no opponent yet, so it is practice for what will come later. :-) 
<P>
Yes, each broomstick has a different max speed and acceleration. This means each broom
has a certain speed and agility. For instance, in the Full Version there is one that is
very fast but hard to control. :-)  In both versions, there is one broom that is hard to
find but is very fast and agile.

Thanks for the idea. However, it would have to be more than half price. This is because
the materials themselves and postage are what cost me money. Adding another game onto the
CD doesn't cost me anything.

Jackson,
<P>
yes, you are right. There are a lot of Australians in here. :-)
<P>
Sure you can. I have sent copies of the game all over the world, and a good number to
Australia. The only trick is sending me $10 US. PayPal can do this, but creating and
verifying an international account can take a while (it is free though). The alternative
is to get your hands on US dollars or a money order from the bank.

<li>Comments: Hi. Got another question. How come in the full version of Broomsticks you can only choose out of six player sets? This may not be the case in newer versions, but I can't get all my character sets up at the same time. It's kinda bugging me. Also something which has my mind on hold is in the items sets. There are two blank spaces. I know that you have answered this before, but I can't be bothered to find the page you answered it on.
<P>
<em>
In the newer version, there are more than 10 character sets. Have you tried
editing the HTML file? You should be able to add an additional character set
that way.
<P>
Two blank spaces? I'm not sure if I remember that. It has been a while since
I looked at the old version.

<li>Comments: Hi again. Sorry, my mistake... Three blank spaces in the items list. One next to the 'Red Ball', one next to the 'Black Ball', and one for the 'Gold Ball'. This may not be the case in newer versions, but I am still confused. Also, is there any way to change the skin for the... uh... 'Spheres' in Broomsticks 3D? At the moment, that would be all I could do! I can't do anything about the broom until I get the right software.
<P>
<em>
Ah, ok, now I know what you are talking about: the items image. Those items have only
one graphic, that is why there are blank spaces. The goalpost has 2 graphics, regular and highlighted.
<P>
Sorry, but right now the spheres in Broomsticks3d are just a solid color, not a skin 
(texture). However, you can change the skins (textures) for the castle and the broom
like you mentioned.

<li>Comments: Hey paul i just thought of how you could make broomsticks even better!!! WHat you could do is have an option called "wide screen field" or something and on this when you are playing, the field is longer and higher than your screen(you can't see the goal posts). Then you could fly all the way to left,right,top, or bottom of the screen and the background would move(you can do this in other games). That way you have a larger area to explore without having a humongous screen. Do you understand??? Would this be easy to do? 
    Thanks!!! ~~~Daniel
<P>
<em>
Daniel,
<P>
That is an interesting idea. However, it would be a problem for two player, because both
players need to see where they are. :-)

I just recieved your Broomsticks CD, It's unbelievable! I love it! But I was wondering, it says that you can install Lasertron onto your computer. What are the advantages of this?
<P>

Adam,
<P>
I'm glad to hear that you are enjoying the <a href="full.html">Full Version</a>. There
is no advantage really, except that you do not need to have the CD in the drive to play.
Also, if you wanted you could change the game graphics. On the CD, the files are read-only.

Thanks Siddharth! I'm glad you like it.

Yes, at some point I will add networking. The only problem is that Broomsticks
is a fast-paced game, and so latency (lag) may be a problem. I did start on this
a while back but wasn't too happy with it. It didn't work too well over a modem
connection.

<li>Comments: Um... About the graphics card... See, I used it from a school computer, and I don't think it has a graphics card. I'm not too sure about it. But yeah, it turns up the gamma rating like you'd change the brightness on a tv. Although it was easy to fix here, it may become a problem for others if they can't change their gamma settings. I'm sure it's a great game, but I simply can't play it because it refuses to operate. It says it performed an illigal operation and closed. If anyone else knows their computer colours (and if you experience the same gamma colour) you'll notice that it 'ups' the colour brightness by 128, but it doesn't affect the three primary colours; that's probably because only one colour is set to 255 and the remaining two are set at 'Numero Zero'. Long story short: I don't know what the graphics card is, but 'M' might! (PS: I'd be very suprised if this message gets a big response message from you. From 'M', not too suprised)

   About broomsticks 3d... sooner or later when you get to play against another opponent will there be a scoreboard? I think it would be cool if it WAS part of the background instead of something off screen. Also, on the full version, it would be cool if you could venture a little bit away from the castle. Like over The Lake. It wouldn't have to be too far though.
<P>
