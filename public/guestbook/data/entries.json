    "response": "Are complex games necessarily better? Think about it for a while. \n\n The truth is that what makes a game good is gameplay. Quality of graphics is also important, but secondary. Why did Tetris sell so well? \n\n There is a Broomsticks 3D. I'm using some of the same code that I used for one of my CAVE projects, but it is a separate game that runs on regular computers. I have the ability to do really high end 3D graphics (that's my job), but the truth is that most people will probably enjoy the regular Broomsticks more than the 3D one.

Which Harry Potter book do you like best? How many mini-disks have you sold or 3.5 floppies of this game? I think it will appeal even to those who aren't fans of Harry Potter.

That way if the image is bigger than BR1 character sets, it can go on to select the additional images needed...god I must need sleep.\n\n Sorry if that's a little hard to understand, but I can't think of another way to explain that at the moment. But you know what I mean, right? It'll mean more code obviously, but it shouldn't be that hard to achieve if it's possible, right?\n\n Right, ok, well, try to make sense of it =D\n *yawn* Cya,\n -Matt\n\n (PS: Thanks for the ability to change the pole image Paul =D)",

So, this means that Broomsticks will, at last, have increased animation, right? Sure, five characters within each set, but that's absolutely fine! Don't need any more than that!\n\n Now, the animation, would it just be, for example, the cape flapping around while flying or something (no in-between actions), or actual in-depth animation, so like, still for example, the cape flapping around, but actions inbetween going up and down or left and right too?\n\n Either way, it'll mean more work for the character creator too, but what the hey! It'll definately put a lot more edge in character set competitions!!\n\n (\\(^o^)/) Yayay!!!!!!!!!! \n\n -Matt",

There's a suggestion or two that I'd like to make for Broomsticks 3D: 1) If you explore the castle for more broomsticks, you should go into a \"walking mode.\" where you can use the mouse to look around and keyboard arrows to move (or mouse buttons.) 2) There should be bigger stands, a referee, and you should wait for the whistle before you can start. (I've only got the demo, so maybe this IS what it's like in the full.) 3) There should be a cheap ($2) and full ($10) version of the game. That way, I don't have to pay as much. Because I live in Oz, the value of the Aussie dollar is about half as much as the US (boo) dollar which works out me paying TWICE AS MUCH as the \"USians.\" PS: Don't try logging on to my website until August 2002: I'm working on it, and I'll have a link on it that goes here!",

Most of the time you can get it to work by getting the newest OpenGL drivers for your graphics card. However, if your computer is older then it may not even have a 3D graphics card or it may have one that does not support OpenGL. \n\n Yes, you can play a GAME and all of the balls are there. However, there is no opponent yet, so it is practice for what will come later. :-) \n\n Yes, each broomstick has a different max speed and acceleration. This means each broom has a certain speed and agility. For instance, in the Full Version there is one that is very fast but hard to control. :-) In both versions, there is one broom that is hard to find but is very fast and agile.",

I'm sure it's a great game, but I simply can't play it because it refuses to operate. It says it performed an illigal operation and closed. If anyone else knows their computer colours (and if you experience the same gamma colour) you'll notice that it 'ups' the colour brightness by 128, but it doesn't affect the three primary colours; that's probably because only one colour is set to 255 and the remaining two are set at 'Numero Zero'.

I think you should up date your guest book (like I have, I hope it works) also up the top it does not mention broomsticks 3D. When I run broomsticks 3D smallscreen (not full screen) I can't see the frames per second or my score also I have an unusualy large screen and an unusuly bad computer so when I enter my screen resolution it goes at 13 fps(aprox, when I look at the sky its fine ;-), when I do it the default way, It flickers. I don't really expect to get a small problem like this fixed it is only my computer not your game!Is the source distributed freely? can you enter the comp 2 times? Why dose broomsticks 3D automaticly shut when you change the hz. Did you program the castle and court file? did you write the engine from scratch? Can I put broomsticks, not just a link, on my site?\n You rule! ;-) Your site rules! :-] Your game rules! ;-D Your guest book rules! :-? \nMy screen res is 1024 by 768 if that helps Rating: I think it rules!",
    "response": "Dougall, \n\n that is a good idea. \n\n If the game is shutting down when you change the refresh rate (hz) it probably means that your graphics card cannot support that particular rate. What have you tried? If I were you, I would try 640x480 at 70, 75, and 80 Hz. \n\n Yes, you can enter the competition two times. \n\n The game is based on the Titan engine. I modified that engine to make Broomsticks 3D. The castle is based on a RA3 map. I made a lot of changes to it though. \n\n Yes, you can put broomsticks on your site! \n\n Thanks!!",

I don't realy think that a screenshots contest is nessecary but we could send you a few broomsticks scrn shots and you could put them in the \"sample screenshots\" section on the homepage. You don't have one of the \"sample screenshots\" pgs. for brm. 3d so I guess you'd have to make a new pg. If you really don't like this Idea, thats fine, just tell us and we'll shut up. :)",

Did you introduce the gold ball, and black balls after you read the Harry Potter books? Otherwise, the game is very unique in its own way, i like the 2D thing. If you could possibly send me some links to some other quidditch games at chakramguy@hotmail.com I would greatly apreciate it.

I've even tried editing the broom image but no matter what that line is always there. I don't think I had this problem before you added the better graphics like the hands on the broom, mountains, etc. Do you know why it is doing this?\n\nDoes anyone else have this problem?",
    "response": "Daniel, \n\n it is probably the texture mapping settings in the OpenGL code. My guess is that the bottom line is wrapping around to the top. Try editing the image and making the bottom couple of lines transparent. Also, if you run the game at a different resolution, the line may disappear.",

    "comments": "QUIDDITCH This game of Quidditch is played on a field 7 boxes long, 3 wide, and 3 high. The Goal-Posts are at either end of the stadium, at ground level, middle square (you can only shoot if youre in this square). The best way to represent this is by making three flat fields, and laying them side by side to show the three levels. BEFORE EACH PLAYER PLAYS Each Bludger moves one square closer to the nearest Seeker. The Quaffle stays still. Then, see whose side the Quaffle is in. This person plays first (if the Quaffle is in the middle, flip a coin.) Then the other player plays. Repeat the process until the Snitch is caught. ON YOUR TURN You may: 1. Move your pieces. 2. Play cards. 3. Replenish your hand to 7 cards. MOVING YOUR PIECES Each Chaser and Beater may move one space in any direction. Chasers may move two, and they may change direction in mid-move. The Keeper must stay in the Goal-Box. If the Quaffle is NOT in anyones possession, and is in the same space as one of your Chasers, it is taken by your Chaser and is now in your possession. Other players cant touch the Quaffle. If the Bludger is in the same space as a Beater, it is hit two spaces in any direction. If any other player is in the same space as a Bludger, they must drop the Quaffle if they have it and get knocked one space in the same direction the Bludger hit them (of course they cant leave the field). PLAYING A CARD Cards are really important. Without cards you cant pass, steal, or shoot! Here are the cards: DIVE A movement boost card. Any Chaser or Beater may move straight down one extra space (Seekers two!). SPRINT A movement boost card. Any Chaser or Beater may move one extra space in any horizontal direction (no diagonals, sorry!)(Seekers two!) ROCKET A movement boost card. Any Chaser or Beater may move straight up one space (Seekers two!) PASS A passing card. You may transfer the Quaffle to any other Chaser one space in any horizontal direction and two spaces in any downward direction (diagonals are OK!)(no upward passes, sorry!) GREAT PASS A passing card. You may transfer the Quaffle to any other Chaser one space in any upwards direction, two spaces in any horizontal direction and three spaces in any downward direction (diagonals are OK!) STEAL You may take possession of the Quaffle if one of your Chasers is in the same box as an opposing Chaser carrying the Quaffle, or you may take possession of the Quaffle if one of your Chasers is in the same box as a Chaser who is receiving a pass, or you may take possession of the Quaffle if one of your Chasers is in any box through which the Quaffle is being passed. This card may be played at any time! SHOOT This card may be played at any time when one of your Chasers, carrying the Quaffle, is in the Goal-Box. Simply pick a number between one and three. Your opponent does the same. If you picked different numbers, you score ten Points and the Quaffle reappears in the center of the pitch (level 2, width 3, length 5)! If you picked the same number, the Keeper blocks the Quaffle and it becomes the possession of the first enemy Chaser to fly into that half of the field. SNITCH When you get this card, the Snitch appears. Dont tell your opponent you have this card! The card will give a set of coordinates in this order: height, length, width. The first Seeker to enter this square earns 150 points for his team, and the game ends. There is only ONE Snitch card! IF your opponent ever stumbles into a square which borders the Snitch square, you MUST show him/her your Snitch card. If they stumble into the Snitch square itself, of course they catch the Snitch! To make the Snitch random, make ten Snitch cards before each game and hide one in the deck. Whoever has the highest score when the Snitch is caught wins!",

For instance, I have an IBM Thinkpad X20 with an ATI Rage Mobility-M and I found the new drivers on IBM's Thinkpad site, not at ATI. \n\n Let me know what kind of performance you get. It runs pretty slowly on my laptop. However, on my desktop (which has an Nvidia GeForce2 Ultra), it runs extremely fast! Really, you need about 15 fps (frames per second) for it to be playable. The more fps you have, the smoother the animation. However, if you get above 60 fps, it doesn't really matter anymore because your eyes can't tell the difference. On my desktop it runs at well over 60, even at high resolutions like 1280x1024!",

Then save them as .jpg and put them into the skin zip file. You need to have the same paths and filenames as the original images in the zip file. Probably the easiest way to do this is to extract the zip archive, replace the images, and then zip it up again. \n\n Yes, most games do use repeating textures.

That's why I host them on my web server and allow people to play them online for free. \n\n With Broomsticks, at first I only had one version (what is now the demo version). I could have kept it that way. However, I decided to try something new. I made a full version that has a bunch of extra features, sounds, and documentation. There are two reasons why I sell the full version: \n\n 1) I run my own web server and serve up a bunch of things. I have to keep my online games very small so that I don't swamp my server. All of the extra features, utilities, and documentation make the full version 30 times bigger than the demo version. The last two months I have had over 100,000 downloads of my demo version (your browser downloads it before you play). If everybody could download my full version that would be too much bandwith. \n\n 2) The full version took me a good amount of time to make and so I think it is worth something. People who have the full version agree with me. :-) I'm not making lots of money off of this, but it is nice to get something. :-)",

The characters won't be able to change to a custom set, so there's one advantage you have. The sound effects will, alas, be dumb and GameBoy-ish, there's another advange you have. There will be NO colour, so there's a big advantage to you...

They have a beater and chaser game. (They are coming out with a seeker and keeper game soon!). It has good graphics and everything but i like your game better.Sadly, i think my parents won't let me buy the full version. ): .While i was in school today, i was daydreaming...Then, i got this great idea for you! You can post adds on the internet for this game. Then when many people know about it, you can make a broomsticks game for gameboy. A gameboy is a hand-held video game made by nintendo. It is very popular. If that succeds, you could make a broomsticks game for Playstation,Playstation2,and nintendo64. Each gameboy game costs $30. lets say there were 1,000,000 kids in the world... You would at least make...$1,000,000!And in the gameboy, there is a slot that you can put a wire in,and you and your friend can play toghther!like a multiplayer broomsticks! I have a few questions to ask you Paul...First, what is your e-mail address?i want to e-mail you.Have you read all the harry potter books that have come out? Which is your favorite? Do you want to see my webpage? Go to www.kiddonet.com. Next, go to the section called homepages. Next type in (Javiter) in the find homepages box. It is case sensitive!!!!!!!Please check my webpage and e-mail me when you do. Got to go now. Bye! P.S:My friends name is Paul too! P.S: Please e-mail me soon. Please think of my ideas about the gameboy! I will try to keep signing your guestbook, BYE! Adios!",
    "response": "Javiter, \n\n I'm doing well. :-) \n\n Your idea is good. However, gameboy is a closed platform. You have to pay a lot of money in order to be able to develop for it. If I do port the game to a handheld, it will probably be to an open one like the Palm Pilot. \n\n My email address is prajlich@ncsa.uiuc.edu. \n\n My favorite Harry Potter book is still the first one. \n\n I tried the search on kiddonet but it did not work. :-(",

Minor quibble: I played a few games against my sister and figured out right away that the easiest way to win is just to stay on top of your opponent and squish them whenever they try to fly. You have complete control of the field - I even beat the best computer mode that way. Maybe instead of starting over on the ground players could just get \"bounced\"? Probably this strategy doesn't work with more than two players.... Wouldn't it be really cool to have a 3D Quidditch game (first-person view, leaning ver your broom i guess) where your mouse pointer directed which way to go? That would combine the best aspects of the top-down view (turns, dodges) with your perspective (dives, climbs). Now THAT would be cool. Signing off, Noodles (no, it's not my real name :-)",
    "response": "Thanks! \n\n True, however, when you add the black balls into the mix it isn't always easy to stay above the other player constantly. It is especially hard if the field is smaller or there are more than 2 black balls. You can control these parameters in the full version. \n\n Actually, I am working on a 3D game. An early version of it comes with the CD. And yes, it is very cool! :-) You use the mouse just like you mentioned!",

So, my answer is that once I finish the game I will find out how to compile it for Mac users. So yes, it will also be for macs unless I run into unforseen problems. \n\n Right now I'm not sure how long it will take. I will let you know though. \n\n I'm planning on including it on the same CD (with Broomsticks), just like I am doing now with the early Windows version.

Here are my ideas: The view is from the player's eyes (like \"noodle\" suggested) and you use the mouse to guide. On the side of the screen is a small map so you can see where everyone else is. You catch, steal, and shoot the Quaffle by clicking the mouse pointer. Of course, you can only steal if you're close enough. Also, there should by all 7 players on a side. Otherwise your game is terrific, I love it! ----Asterix le Gaulois (new to america, sorry for misspellings!)",

If you want to know more about it either reply to this or send me the full version of this game. LOL But you can always hack a PSX CD and then test it with Bleem! (Bleem! cost $30 and i will send it to you for free for your broomsticks full version) LOL Also, it's a pretty good game i just wish i was allowed to send $10 dollars :(",
    "response": "Brad is right. Consoles are generally \"closed\" platforms. This means that you are supposed to use expensive development tools that come from the console manufacturer. Of course, there are people who hack and reverse engineer consoles. I've found a bunch of stuff but I don't really have the time to get into this sort of thing. \n\n However, Sega Dreamcast announced that they will have a web browser that supports Java. This means that you will be able to play the online version of Broomsticks on a Dreamcast. I'll have to look into this... \n\n Still, Brad, I'm interested in the program that you mentioned. \n\n I normally do really high end 3D graphics for million dollar Virtual Reality Systems. You can read more on my [homepage](../). That stuff is amazing! However, very few people have access to such equipment.",

When your done, zip all those files back together and make sure that .zip file isn't named the same thing as any other Broomstick 3D file. To use this skin while playing the game you have to make sure that it has the \".zip\" at the end of its file name and that all other skin files do not. To remove the \".zip\" from a file name just rename the file. Then when you run the game your new skin should be applied.\n\nHope that covers anything. I haven't made a skin in a long time so if I missed something sorry.",

It would be really cool if u made a full version of it, instead of just flying around and catching gold balls (don't get me wrong, i like playing the game), it would be really cool if you made a Quidditch version of Broomsticks 3D, like Broomsticks, you know, I know that isn't easy, i do a little programming too, but i just noticed that you are good, and thought i'd make the suggestion, cya round The Man!",

But the thing is the computer play is too easy, once you have mastered the game like me! :) I might try playing with a friend though. Thanks!!!",
    "response": "Thanks James! I'm glad you like the [Full Version](full.html)! \n\n If Broomsticks 3D is running that slow, that means that the OpenGL driver for your graphics card is not installed. Find out what graphics card you have, go to the website, and see if they have OpenGL drivers. Most cards do, but some cards only support Direct3D. :-( \n\n That's true about Lasertron. I meant it to be a two-player game and so I didn't spend much time on the computer player. Sometime I should improve that.",

Keep up the good work Paul! - Nick",
    "response": "Thanks Nick! \n\n I'm a programmer and so I made Broomsticks from scratch using the Java programming language. Programming can take years to master, but it is well worth it. I started when I was in grade school! \n\n As for your suggestion, that would be cool. If I have time I should try doing something like that. I have done networking before. The only problem with doing networking for Broomsticks is that Java only trusts the host for security reasons. This means that all network traffic for the game would have to go through my computer, which would probably be too much given the number of people that are playing Broomsticks!

I kinda got lazy and haven't worked on QBasic for awhile, and am currently making movies on Flash 5. I went to QBasic.com and it's help section only goes so far and i'm left guessing what to do next with it. It doesn't teach you much and i was thinking maybe you have found a better faq for QB. Anywayz, it's 12:00 pm here, so I should get to sleep... CU l8r",

It's too easy to find the current brooms. Also for the snitch, could you make it zoom all around the castle so you have to chase it through everything. That would make it more fun. Oh, and when you add opponents could you also add the option for team mates so someone could just be the seeker and someone could just be the chaser. Could you also make walls around the castle so it doesn't look like you can fly out but you then run right into an invisible wall. I know this seems like alot but it would make this great game much better. Also it would make it a little more \"re-playable.\"",

    "comments": "WOW! Your Broomsticks Experts Demo is super! The first time I gave it a shot I actually lost the game-but only by ten. I was so mad at the game the second time I played I kept getting the bludgers around my hoop, and lost far more miserably that time. But now I'm winning all the time by 50-nil or 50-10, so things are back to normal, although this is definatly the best Quidditch game on the net! I should know, I've probably been to every web page that has the slightest mention of Harry Potter, Quidditch, Hogwarts or magic! I'm even enrolled to many virtual Hogwarts schools, and for some I'm on the Ravenclaw Quidditch team! But this is the best of all games, and I think that with your talent and clever ideas, it will be for quite some time!",
    "response": "Thanks Nika! For even more challenge, make sure you hit f to make the computer player even harder! \n\n However, the Full Version is much much better than the Experts Demo. In the next few days, I'm going to put up a demo version that will hopefully give people a better idea of what the Full Version is like. \n\n Thanks again! Comments like this make me glad that I made this game!",

If you put your game on Game boy Advance then maybe you can make your game popular. I liked your games as a online game, but I don't think it could make it as a arcade game. pretty soon people will stop playing your game. the other day I was playing your game with a friend, it needs to get more details,details,details. Before you toss those tomatoes at me, listen up. Get your game on a system like GameboyAdvance. Say...... there was.. 90 million kids in the world who would buy a gameboy advance so they could get their grubby little hands on it. Maybe there would be a small 3 million that would buy your game. each game usually costs about $30. you can earn maybe a million dollars off that. Why? So your game can get popular with advertisements. And make the game a little BETTER the original game isnt something to mess up .I say better loosely. Now that's marketing. just dont lean on the advertisements so heavily. And email me? I will try to sign your guestbook as much as possible. Plus you get alink cable to play with a 3 friends by Nintendo. I want to help you. Any questions? Plese Email me?",

You should advertise it on VHS video tapes to get people excited about you games. Use in store demos. Some people know nothing of your great games. I still remember watching a Pokemon videotape put together by Nintendo By the time I finished watching it I rushed to the store to prepay for the game. People ARE excited about more advanced technology. You should know it is the quality of the games. Your games are so great they are to me the best type of game ever for now. I had megatons of fun with you game. The broomsticks game is good too. Is there really a 3D broomsticks? But its got to be challenging too. I think you games requires more strategy than the average quiddich game. Your game surprisingly to me has more depth thare an other games of its type Its interesting. And fun-in-depth! your games are definetely worth checking out. Not a bad premise in any of your games and the control is quite to be desired. In this world there is only winners and there is losers. and the people I know are all losers. i beat them all at you broomsticks game.The characters in the game lool great with a crisp and detailed cartoon style. Your games are great! I rate them all a 10!",

I'm glad that so many people like the Broomsticks gameplay. \n\n Yes, there is a Broomsticks 3D. So far, I've spent most of my time working on the rendering engine (it's a Quake3 style renderer).

The advantage of the PC is that you can get newer hardware as it comes out (a console's hardware doesn't change).

I got the full version of this game from you about a year ago, and made some characters but could never send them to you, and then i lost the address of this site! I couldn't find this site but have recently found it. I like the ideas about the 3D game, but would it run slow on a PII? It wouldn't matter about connection speed if you get the full version though I think. And another suggestion that I asked ages ago is for networking / internet play capabilities. PS I have recently lost my Broomsticks game as my dad reformatted the harddrive to install Windows 2000, please could you email me a new copy? If you won't, email me anyway so I know your email addy :) brad17@greatestgamers.com",

    "comments": "I have some more things that you might like that I forgot to post: 1) You might want to consider buying Install Maker (Pro). It's a REALLY cool install program maker. I just think FreeExtractor's just not enough (I downloaded it, 'cause I noticed you used it for BR3D.) You can get it from \"www.clickteam.com\" If you get the PRO version (99$ US), you can create seperate versions of the program (Install Broomsticks & Broomsticks 3D in the same installer!) and it's really easy to use. Just, if you DO buy it, and you get PRO, just make sure any \"Mutually Exclusive\" check boxes are clear. The NORMAL version ($29 US I think) is pretty cool too. What's really cool, is that if you're building your installer onto a floppy, if it takes more than the capacity of the disk, it spans the installer across the disk. When you install Install Maker, it only takes up 1-2MB of disk space! And the installers it creates (you create!), the actual wizard, is only 60KB and the files in it is compressed EQUAL to the compression of WinZip!!! I highly recommend it, and the installer to install Install Maker is an example of an installer made with Install Maker PRO, and you can also try unregistered versions of it (no evaluation) which just have an ad screen at the end. 2) I think it's VERY rude to post rude comments on guestbooks. Anyone does is VERY rude. Paul Rajlich went to all the LOTS OF EFFORT of making these games and people say stuff like \"MONKEY ? IS WAY BETTER THAN BROOMSTICKS\"! Of course that <- is completely the opposite. I think you maybe should create a submitting script that scans the comments for stuff like that and removes those entries. 3) You've got a good brain, Paul. 4) You might also want to get The Games Factory or Jamagic to make Broomsticks, also from clickteam.com Cheers, Jeremy",
    "response": "Thanks for the info Jeremy. \n\n As for the negative comments, I don't mind. The only comments that I remove are ones that are clearly offensive (bad language). Besides, most of the posts are very positive. Thanks everybody! \n\n The game makers look interesting. However, a programmer like myself will always want to program. :-) Even the most powerful game makers will not give you the control that programming will...",

NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE IT'LL GET TO YOU SOMEHOW. I'm very interested in designing things and I'm in the middle of desingning a Quiddich board game (If you're wondering I'm 12). I had an idea for a simple computer game (I had java in mind). Theonly problem is how to put it from paper onto the computor. Paul! What do you use to make your games or is it just a list of tags or something like that. Please let me know. Alex.",

If you still don't know what I mean I will explain it again.Ok,the piont is if you make a place for all online Broomsticks players to play with each other,they could jion a game.Each game have 4 players in it and there will be a red team and a blue team against each other.Imagine,a place where all Broomsticks players could meet each other,talk to each other,play with each other.Joining games,team works,make friends.and That means you could play with other people online,not just yourself.So please do it,PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Needs more realistic looking characters, but I'm sure you're already working on that =) My friends and I enjoy playing the game, even if it is in school time. I am hoping that to upgrade the characters shouldn't be too hard, considering that they were origionally made in a simple paint program. I am also hoping that to upgrade the Buldgers (Black balls), Quaffel (Red ball) and the Snitch (Golden ball) should not be so hard either. I hope that a new version of this magnificent game (Broomsticks 3000) will be released soon enough. Containing all the Quidditch playing balls, proper Quidditch rules, the option to play as different players (Seeker, Goal Keeper, ect.) in a choice of a computer generated team or a network team, and realistic graphics, I'm sure that with all that, Broomsticks would surely get between 7/10 to a great 10/10! I hope to hear a bit of information and conformation about those ideas. Matthew Davis tpga6780@tpg.com.au",
    "response": "Matthew, \n\n I'm glad you like the game. Changing the characters is very easy. There's a really cool set of characters by Darren Harden in the [ Characters Gallery](characters.html). If you decide to make your own characters, send them to me and I'll be glad to post them on this site. \n\n Those are all good ideas but would require a lot of work!

I really, really, really want the full version, unfortunatly I can't get it because of my father. He claims that the price is too much when it's only $10 of American dollors (I think that's about 20-25 dollers in our money). Because I'm not allowed to get it and I'm sure other kids parents don't let them either, can you please include the golden snitch?????????????? If you can't, that's okay, this is a really cool game any way. If you or anybody else who is reading this have the full version, make some animal characters, ok. That will make this game even cooler! PS. I heard you are making a updated version called broomsticks 3000- when will that be out and how much will it cost?????? Once again, this game rocks!!!!!",

Hey, did I say a bit more than wow? Thought so =) Have you been working on it? It sure does look like it. Ok, I better stop asking questions. Oh, and if you're into horses as well, I've got a site here with only seven pictures, but they're pretty cool pictures. I don't want to advertise or anything, but please visit! I've only had eight hits, and that was me! Ok, gotta go. Bye!!!!",
    "response": "Matthew, \n\n yep, the new Broomsticks 3d demo is a lot different than the demo that came with the old version of the CD. I made those changes and added the hoops. The reasoning behind the new white block textures is that they are very bright and have a lot of contrast. This way, people with dim monitors and/or bad gamma settings can still see something. :-) I also reduced the size of the castle and the number of textures to make the downloadable demo smaller. In the Full Version, you get the full castle (more than twice as big). \n\n Yep, you can open the skin files with WinZip. \n\n Yes, of course I have been working on it. :-) \n\n Just went to your website.

I think this would make it easier on hp fans because all the news and great gaming would be on one site, because i hate having to go to 2 or three info. sites and then go to a separate site for gaming, plus i think it would help bring in some more people to the broomsticks site.
