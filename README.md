# Broomsticks

**Live at [broomsticks.xyz](https://broomsticks.xyz)**

A preservation and modernization project for **Broomsticks**, originally created by **Paul Rajlich**.

## About

Broomsticks is a classic multiplayer game where players on flying broomsticks compete to collect balls and score points. Originally released as a Java applet in the early 2000s, it was later ported to C++/SDL and iOS.

This repository preserves all original source code and aims to bring the game to modern web browsers.
