<P>
Sell Broomsticks, have fun, and make money! All you have to do to get started is order a
<a href="full.html">10 pack</a>. If you sell all 10 for $10 a piece, you
make <b>$40</b>! It's that simple!

<font size=+2><b>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</b></font>
<P>
<b>Why is is that 1 CD costs $10 but 10 costs only $60?</b><br>
There are two main reasons. First, I can send all 10 in one package which
is cheaper than sending 10 packages. Second, and more importantly, I make
less money per game for the 10 pack. So why am I doing it? I want as many
people as possible to have
the game, and I think that a lot of people would rather buy it from a friend
than online or by mail from me. So, this 10 pack idea is to get more copies
out there. For helping me do that, you can make some easy money! Or, you can
give your friends a nice discount! :-)
<P>
<b>What if I get the 10 pack but can't sell them all?</b><br>
I doubt that will happen. But, if it does, just
send 6 CDs back to me and I will refund you $30 or send 8 CDs back
to me and I will refund you $44.
<P>
Basically, here's the deal:
<P>
You sell 10, you make $40!!<br>
You sell 9, you make $30 and you have 1 free copy leftover for yourself!<br>
You sell 8, you make $20 and you have 2 free copies leftover for you and a friend!<br>
You sell 7, you make $10 and you have 3 free copies leftover for you and two friends!<br>
You sell 6, you make  $0 but you have 4 free copies leftover to give away or sell cheap!<br>
You sell 5, you paid $10 but you have 5 copies to give away or sell cheap!<br>
You sell 4, send back 6 copies and you made $10!<br>
You sell 3, send back 6 copies and you have 1 free copy for yourself!<br>
You sell 2, send back 8 copies and you made $4!<br>
You sell 1, send back 8 copies and you have 1 copy that cost you only $6!<br>
You sell 0, send back 8 copies and you have 2 copies that cost you $16 total<br>

<P>
<b>I don't have $60, can I still sell Broomsticks?</b><br>
Yes. Order <a href="full.html">1 copy</a> for $10 and show it to people. Collect
money for orders. Once you have collected $50, let me know and I will
send you the rest of the 10 pack (9 more) for those $50. So, the result is that
you got the 10 pack for $60 but you didn't have to pay the $60 up front.
<P>
<b>Ok, I want to get started! What do I do?</b><br>
