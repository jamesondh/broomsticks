## The Economics of Childhood: $10 and Parental Gatekeepers

The guestbook reveals the fundamental tension of early internet commerce: children with no purchasing power trying to acquire a $10 game.

> "I really like your Broomsticks game. I want the full version but my parents won't let me have 10 bucks."
> — [guests-04.html#aug20-jerrycorne-49](guestbook/guests-04.html#aug20-jerrycorne-49)

> "Great game! I tried 2000 gold balls, and it's InSaNe! I want to order it, but I spent all my money on... wait a minute, I never had any money in the first place -_-"
> — [guests-dec01.html#dec1-matthicks-2](guestbook/guests-dec01.html#dec1-matthicks-2)

> "Whoa! Ten bucks American! You've gotta be kidding! My mom and dad wont let me have that! Lower the price! You'll get more money that way!"
> — [guests-oct.html#oct8-android4-38](guestbook/guests-oct.html#oct8-android4-38) (Canada)

> "YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My parents finally said that we can get the full version!!!! I can't wait for it to get here! I had to do a lot of chores to get it but YES!!!!!!!!!"
> — [guests-aug.html#aug18-mike-21](guestbook/guests-aug.html#aug18-mike-21)

> "Your game is wicked but Mum won't let us buy it so I guess we will have to visit your site again...and again...and again...and again"

## International Currency Confusion: The Pre-PayPal Struggle

Before PayPal became ubiquitous, international payment was a nightmare for children.

> "I think Broomsticks (3D) is pretty cool. It's just that I live in Australia, so that I can't really afford the full version... Because I live in Oz, the value of the Aussie dollar is about half as much as the US (boo) dollar which works out me paying TWICE AS MUCH as the 'USians.'"
> — [guests-may02.html#may9-jeremy-12](guestbook/guests-may02.html#may9-jeremy-12)

> "Sad you cant add networking. I have a friend here that rarely meets me, and then we often play Broomsticks Advanced. But we are sad because we cant do networking... I cant buy the Full Version, sorry. I do not have American money and besides, If I had I wouldnt be able to because I'm not allowed to."
> — [guests-may02.html#may29-siddharth-41](guestbook/guests-may02.html#may29-siddharth-41)

> "I like your game and wouldn't mind getting it although I live in england (sob!) Is there ne way to get it to me?"
> — [guests-sep.html#sep9-shaun-8](guestbook/guests-sep.html#sep9-shaun-8) (UK)

> **Paul's Response:** "Sure, you can get it! I've had a good number of orders from England."

> "Paul would u send to Canada? Because i see alot of other countries on there. Just making sure."
> — [guests-aug02.html#aug16-devin-40](guestbook/guests-aug02.html#aug16-devin-40)

> **Paul's Response:** "Of course! I get more orders from Canada than from any other country except the United States."

## September 11, 2001: History Intersecting with a Kids' Game

The guestbook captures a remarkable historical moment when world events directly impacted game distribution.

> "Hey! I sent in money for broomsticks 2.5 weeks ago, should i get it soon? I know you were out of town, and those idiots screwed up New York (which may have delayed air mail) but still it's taking to long!!!!"
> — [guests-sep.html#sep18-no-12](guestbook/guests-sep.html#sep18-no-12) (September 2001)

> **Paul's Response:** "Ok, I got your email and checked my records. I sent the game on Monday, Sept. 10. The crisis in New York and the grounding of airplanes may have slowed mail."

> "Sorry I've been gone so long. You don't need to make me a patch, it's PERFECT as it is. By the way, is there any chance we'll see a Broomsticks Tournament? With prizes & everything? It might get us Broomsticks players even closer. (Closer? after the attacks?) Think about a Broomsticks Olympics, okay? P.S. May we always and forever stand as the United States of America!"
> — [guests-sep.html#sep20-aaron-14](guestbook/guests-sep.html#sep20-aaron-14) (September 20, 2001)

> User location listed as: *"Men are from Mars. Women are from Venus. I, however, am from Earth, a planet that would be peaceful if there were no terrorists."*
> — *guests-sep.html*

> "Has anyone else here got an e-mail or something about Nostradamus 'Prophesying' about the WTC attacks? Don't believe it, it's a hoax, just one BIG mix and match thingy. P.S. God bless the U.S.A!"
> — [guests-sep.html#sep21-aaron-16](guestbook/guests-sep.html#sep21-aaron-16)

## Schools & Libraries: Where Broomsticks Spread Virally

The game became a social phenomenon in computer labs and libraries.

> "BEST GAME EVER! At school we get a time for 2 people to go on a computer and whenever that time comes me and my friends go we would switch back and forth! I even remember the day when we had 4 players! We did a 2v2 it was insane!"
> — [guests-dec01.html#dec15-tyler-31](guestbook/guests-dec01.html#dec15-tyler-31)

> — [guests-mar.html#mar12-jpandhisfr-51](guestbook/guests-mar.html#mar12-jpandhisfr-51)

> "Hey Paul, your site really rocks. I love it 100%... I would like to ask on behalf of all my 40 friends (who play this game at school) to put the full version online just for a bit of time."
> — [guests-nov01.html#nov20-ianhyrule-30](guestbook/guests-nov01.html#nov20-ianhyrule-30)

> **Paul's Response:** "Maybe you and your friends should pool your money together and get a 4 pack! :-)"

> "Your game is amazing. My friends and I found it a few weeks ago during downtime during computer science class, and have been hooked on it ever since."
> — [guests-dec02.html#dec23-lee-32](guestbook/guests-dec02.html#dec23-lee-32)

> — [guests-jan03.html#jan7-fauna-2](guestbook/guests-jan03.html#jan7-fauna-2)

> — [guests-dec01.html#dec18-jessicaqui-37](guestbook/guests-dec01.html#dec18-jessicaqui-37)

> "Although I am 18, I am an avid reader of Harry Potter and Am taking my brothers to see the movie on the 16 of Nov. when it comes out here in the states. Anyway, I can't wait to see the look on my brothers faces when they see the game, they will be in heaven, keep up the good work.

> — [guests-jun.html#jun3-charlie-6](guestbook/guests-jun.html#jun3-charlie-6)

> **Paul's Response:** "I wrote the game from scratch using the Java programming language: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/"

> "Thanks alot again, Paul. I have mastered Basic but JavaScript is a bit too complex and time consuming for me at the moment (I can only use the PC 30 min a day) so I have decided to take up flash first."
> — [guests-may.html#may2-dustingabr-0](guestbook/guests-may.html#may2-dustingabr-0)

> **Paul's Response:** "Good to see that you are programming! You are welcome."

> "What a superb game! I was almost jumping with excitement when I was playing. I am in Class 5 now and I am going to learn Java very soon (you can laugh but it's true!)"
> — [guests-may.html#may25-chiradeepr-50](guestbook/guests-may.html#may25-chiradeepr-50)

> **Paul's Response:** "Thanks! Good luck with the programming and have fun!"

## The CAVE Connection: When Kids Discovered Paul's Day Job

Some users stumbled upon Paul's work at NCSA with million-dollar supercomputers.

> "Love the game! Ever think of modeling the quidditch pitch in CAVE? That would be incredible! Especially if you could make it so you could fly on a broomstick around the pitch!"
> — [guests-dec01.html#dec7-josh-15](guestbook/guests-dec01.html#dec7-josh-15)

> **Paul's Response:** "Thanks! I have thought of that. Actually, I can run my Broomsticks 3D in the CAVE!"

> "Paul, you haven't sent me an email yet. Anyway, do you know C/C++? Obviously you know JAVA but I was wondering if you knew C/C++, as I wanted to know what language you use to code the CAVE."
> — [guests-jul.html#jul4-brad17-13](guestbook/guests-jul.html#jul4-brad17-13)

> **Paul's Response:** "For CAVE programs, I use the SGI compiler since the CAVE runs off of a million dollar SGI system."

> "your game is basic, a little complex, but still pretty insignificant compared to other games your price!... those screen shots are fake, theres no broomsticks 3-d. thats just some other game your developing at cave."
> — [guests-jul.html#jul26-nameless-62](guestbook/guests-jul.html#jul26-nameless-62)

> **Paul's Response:** "Broomsticks 3D uses the same engine as one of my CAVE projects, but it is a separate game that runs on regular [computers]"

## The Copyright Question: Dodging Warner Bros.

Players and observers noticed Paul's clever legal maneuvering.

> "I'm impressed about how you avoided the copyrights by not using any names... I wouldn't have thought of that."
> — [guests-dec01.html#dec1-matthicks-2](guestbook/guests-dec01.html#dec1-matthicks-2)

> "It seems you were wise not to use such words as 'snitch', 'bludger', 'quidditch', or even 'Harry Potter'. Apparently some of the other (less bright) programmers are encountering legal complications."
> — [guests-dec.html#dec29-rkjowling-95](guestbook/guests-dec.html#dec29-rkjowling-95)

> "Can we call the balls by their real names when talking about them in this guestbook or will that violate some copyright thing?"
> — [guests-oct02.html#oct10-daniel-16](guestbook/guests-oct02.html#oct10-daniel-16)

> "Sorry for signing this so much, but I have another question. I was thinking about what that jerk 'HELLO' said, and can J.K. sue you? I know you say 'Red ball' and 'Black ball' and 'tiny fast gold ball'. but can she sue you anyways?"
> — [guests-apr03.html#apr21-steve-31](guestbook/guests-apr03.html#apr21-steve-31)

> **Paul's Response:** "Really, the most important thing to J.K. and Warner Brothers are the names."

> "No J.K. Rowling or Warner Bros. cannot sue Paul because his game is called 'Broomsticks' not 'Quidditch' which is a copyrighted name. He also refers to them as 'red/black/gold ball' as you said above."
> — [guests-apr03.html#apr21-daniel-33](guestbook/guests-apr03.html#apr21-daniel-33)

> "You might get into serious trouble for using the quidditch game for commercial purposes without having an official license from warner bros..."

## Early Internet Toxicity & Community Defense

The guestbook shows early patterns of online harassment and community response.

### The "Mysterymonkey" Flame War

> "I have better games than this on my site, they are free as well. And have tournaments, etc. Go to www.mysterymonkey.1fx.net"
> — [guests-dec.html#dec2-harry-4](guestbook/guests-dec.html#dec2-harry-4)

> "HELLO!!! EARTH TO U LOT!! WWW.MYSTERYMONKEY.1FX.NET HAS WAAAAAYYYYY BETTER GAMES!!!! FOR FREE!!!! WITH TOURNAMENTS!!!! AND TRAINING!!!! AND WEATHER CONDITIONS!!!! AND DECENT GRAPHICS!!!! AND THERE ARE OVER 15 DIFFERENT ONES!!!"
> — [guests-dec.html#dec2-johnny-7](guestbook/guests-dec.html#dec2-johnny-7)

Community Response:

> "I went on that monkey kids games. It's keyboarding and there's no graphics. Your game is definitely better and thanks for info on making games."
> — [guests-dec.html#dec11-robin-37](guestbook/guests-dec.html#dec11-robin-37)

> "This is a great site. mysterymonkey games dont always work and you have to download them. your site is easy and quick to start up because it is online... the games never work on mine and my friends computer so I dont go any more."
> — [guests-dec.html#dec15-shane-50](guestbook/guests-dec.html#dec15-shane-50)

> "Your game is a lot better than that stupid Mysterymonkey's or whatever his name is."
> — [guests-dec.html#dec18-mudboyjimm-63](guestbook/guests-dec.html#dec18-mudboyjimm-63)

> "Everyone who signed this guestbook and read 'mysterymonkey's comments, should have received an email that said that the mysterymonkey person was ACTUALLY an imposter, and that mysterymonkey has no bad feelings toward Paul's work (In fact, they like it!)"
> — [guests-jan.html#jan16-sara-38](guestbook/guests-jan.html#jan16-sara-38)

### Jeremy the Defender

> "I think it's VERY rude to post rude comments on guestbooks. Anyone who does is VERY rude. Paul Rajlich went to all the LOTS OF EFFORT of making these games and people say stuff like 'MONKEY ? IS WAY BETTER THAN BROOMSTICKS'!"
> — [guests-jun02.html#jun2-jeremy-0](guestbook/guests-jun02.html#jun2-jeremy-0) (Jeremy)

> **Paul's Response:** "Thanks for the info Jeremy."

### The "Haters"

> "THIS GAME SUCKS THE CHARECTERS CAN'T MOVE AND THERE IS NO WAY I AM PLAYING AGAIN I HATE IT THE DOWN ARROW DOESENT WORK AND THEY KEEP MOVING WHEN I LET GO OF THE ARROWS AND THE BLUDGERS DON'T EFFECT COMPUTER PLAYERS AND JK ROWLING SHOULD SUE YOU AND SO THERE!"
> — [guests-apr03.html#apr21-hello-27](guestbook/guests-apr03.html#apr21-hello-27)

> "harry and i recently played your game and it does not live up to the standards that we expected in other words it SUCKS! he said that quidditch, the real thing is ssssssooooooooo much better"
> — [guests-aug.html#aug18-chochang-22](guestbook/guests-aug.html#aug18-chochang-22)

> "This guestbook is out of control, Paul needs to get someone with a little more time on their hands to at least delete the stupid posts."
> — [guests-jun03.html#jun11-larrin-40](guestbook/guests-jun03.html#jun11-larrin-40)

> **Paul's Response:** "I can delete the stupid posts, but then posts like yours (which are about the stupid posts) will not make sense."

---

## Better Than the Official Games

Players consistently compared Broomsticks favorably to official Harry Potter games.

> "better than the h.p. quidditch game at www.harrypotter.com! which look like a playstation game....its sucks, this one is way better!"
> — [guests-aug.html#aug4-mlthed-3](guestbook/guests-aug.html#aug4-mlthed-3)

> **Paul's Response:** "Thanks! That's what I want to hear. :-)"

> "Broomsticks is fun. It is like no other 'Quidditch' game I have played. In most other games you can't even hold the 'Quaffle', it just bounces off your character. In other games, the 'Bludgers' don't hit you at all, and the 'Snitch' could fly around for HOURS before it EVER gets caught. Broomsticks, however, is perfect."
> — [guests-jul.html#jul18-aaron-49](guestbook/guests-jul.html#jul18-aaron-49)

> "I got Harry Potter #2 for PC, and the Quidditch was terrible. It was so stupid, you AUTOMATICALLY follow the Golden Snitch. Your B3D is Much better."
> — [guests-nov02.html#nov29-daniel-62](guestbook/guests-nov02.html#nov29-daniel-62)

## Technical Era: 56k Modems and Old Computers

> "Can I download it to my hard disk and learn - I'm really glad that it doesn't require Flash or a Java plugin as such - my computer is old and slow (clone, 1997), and I've only been on the Internet since April last year (2000)."
> — [guests-mar.html#mar2-adelaidela-5](guestbook/guests-mar.html#mar2-adelaidela-5)

## Final Note

These comments span from 2001-2005, capturing a unique moment in internet history when:
- A supercomputer researcher made a kids' game on the side
- Physical mail was still required for software distribution
- $10 USD was a fortune requiring parental negotiation
- 9/11 affected game delivery times
- Warner Bros. aggressively litigated HP fan content
- Java applets were cutting-edge web technology
- Kids dreamed of learning to program from playing games

The Broomsticks guestbook is a time capsule of the early web's innocence, creativity, and community.
