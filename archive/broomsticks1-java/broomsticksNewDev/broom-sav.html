This game is loosely based on Quidditch. Quidditch is the game described in 
the Harry Potter series. You can think of this game as a simplified, 1-on-1
version of Quidditch.

Here is a fun little applet inspired by the game Quidditch from the
Harry Potter series.

<!--
It's a lot more constrained than the game described in the books.
However, these constraints make it playable. Think of it as 1-on-1
Quidditch. :-)
<P>
-->

To play, first click on the applet. Then, control player 1 using the arrow
keys. Control player 2 using the E, S, and F keys. It's easier to just
click on the keys rather than hold them down. Click on your up
key several times to start flying.
<P>
<font color=#ff0000>
NEW! Press the P key to have the computer control player 2. Adjust skill
level with S and F.
</font>

<!--During play, you can change your player using 1 or ENTER.-->
<!--
Also, you can change your player using 1 or ENTER. If it runs choppy,
try clicking on start again.
-->

<P>
The rules of the game are:
<ol>
<li> When two players collide, the player that is lower is bumped
    to the bottom of the screen.
<li> When a player collides with a black ball, the player is bumped.
<li> When a player gets close to the red ball, the player catches the ball.
<li> When a player puts the red ball in the opponent's hoop, 10
    points are scored.
<li> First player to score 50 points wins.
</ol>
Click here to play:

Have fun! If you haven't played against a friend, you haven't played! :-)
