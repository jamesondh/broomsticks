        <p>I don't mean to underestimate you or anything Paul, but did you draw the mountains and lake (background) from scratch? That is some amazing stuff! I have got to learn to draw like that! The problem I have is when I draw on paint, under the microscope it would look terrible and real fuzzy. But whenyou zoom out to normal view it looks awesome. I don't know haow people draw that good.</p>

      <div class="entry-response"><p>I did not make that background. The backgrounds are called skyboxes. Do a search on skybox and you will find examples and tutorials. Many times, they are made with tools like Bryce and Poser rather than drawn by hand.</p></div>

        <p>Hey Paul, i see that the site is coming along fine. I always like to check back here to see how it's all goin'. Nice game exept for BS3d. I mean, the graphics are great but you're on your own. You should have two teams facing off at each other. Like in the old broomsticks game. But add 7 on a team like in the books and movies. But, all in all I would say they're both coming along real well. Later, Ted Kendrick</p>

        <p>HIYA HEYA HOYA BOO! Sorry, I'm a little hyped up. About the upcoming Broomsticks 3D Sky/Broom contest, if it's a sky contest, how would it be possible to make one? Do you need a special plug-in for Bryce or something? Oh yeah, I've started work on a fantastic character set for Broomsticks. Fans of Kirby, be ready for Kirby's Mega-Mix, made exclusively for Paul Rajilich's Broomsticks. (Mega-Mix is also a Remix of all of the tunes from Kirby's Adventure I'm working on) As for JVM, I'll check it out. I still have to get home yet. See, I'm at school at the moment. Oh well, got-sa go-sa! Bye...-sa!</p>

        <p>It would be cool if there were other items that you could find in the castle. I don't know what they could be though. </p>
<p> You know when you get the invisible broom, what exactly does it do? I'v gotten it before, does it make you invincible to the blck balls for a little while. Also Paul,when you have time you should give the red and black balls more roundness like you did on reg. broom. (put a little shine on the edges). Can we call the balls by their real names when talking about them in this guestbook or will that violate some copyright thing?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="entry-response"><p>Daniel, </p>
<p> I do plan to add other powerups in the future. The invisibility makes it so that the balls do not know where you are. I do plan to improve the graphics for the balls and brooms. </p>
<p> You can use the real names in the guestbook. I just can't use them to promote my game.</p></div>

        <p>Paul, I am finally going to try to make some skins but I have a question...When I open a skin_.zip file it shows two folders &quot;Texures&quot; and &quot;Texures&quot;. Why does it have 2 copies of the samething? Do I edit both of the files or just one? Also to edit the picture(of a skin) can we edit the pictures on paint, save them as a .jpg and then paste the file in the &quot;Texures&quot; folder?</p>
<p> To edit the sky, do we need a file from you (I didn't notice if there were &quot;Skys&quot; on the Broom. 3d menu) or is it all ready there. Let us know when the contests will begin. Thanks!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="entry-response"><p>The best way to work with the skins and skies is to extract the zip files into the Broomsticks3D directory. You don't need to zip them back up until you are ready to send them into to me. The engine will pick up the files when they are unzipped. Let me know if you have any questions...</p></div>

        <p><span class="inline-hidden"> Thanks Ted! I do plan to add a computer opponent to br3d. However, teamplay could potentially make the game very complicated. We will see... </span> Paul, first of all you need to add HTML. It'de be a lot cooler in the guestbook. And second, Multipull teames wouldn't be that hard. I can imagine it might be hard for you cuz you're doin' all the work. But it would be kinda' interesting. You know what I mean. Thak you For Your Time, Ted Kendrick</p>
      </div>
      <div class="entry-response"><p>HTML should work in the guestbook. </p>
<p> I think the gameplay could get complicated. If there are multiple human players playing over a network, it might be ok. But if there are multiple computer players, its hard to make them smart enough to play as a team.</p></div>

        <p>Paul, I am going to make some skins! But I need a favor. I can edit everything but the brooms. I can't do the brooms because my computer is old and cannot save the brooms as .tga . So could I edit the brooms and save them as a jpg. and then e-mail them to you to change to .tga . So you could send them back to me? Will that even work? Thanks!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="entry-response"><p>Excellent! If you want to do that, save them as bmp or gif, not jpg. They will convert to TGA better. Also, make sure the background is a solid color so that it can be made transparent.</p></div>

        <p>Sorry about the blank one above. I have some ideas for sound when you add it. 1) When you score a goal it makes a nice &quot;ding&quot; sound (kind of like in the movie) followed by some applause. 2) There is some good background music while your flying outside or on the field, but when you go inside the castle the music becomes darker, kind of mysterious. 3) When you get a new broom it makes a kind of &quot;ping&quot; sound or something.</p>
