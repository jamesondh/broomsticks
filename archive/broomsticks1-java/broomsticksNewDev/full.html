Visit the <a href="http://brighton.ncsa.uiuc.edu/~prajlich/broomsticks/gallery.html">Broomsticks Gallery</a> to see screenshots of the full version. This is
also the place where owners of the full version can exchange their characters and other artwork.
<!--
Why am I selling a full version? There are two main reasons. First, I run my own
web server. Because this game is popular, I am keeping the online version very small
so that it doesn't swamp my server. I want it to download quickly for everybody.
The <b>full version</b> has all the extra goodies mentioned above! Second, I'm
hoping to sell enough copies to buy myself a new computer for home. Thanks for
your support! :-)
